# EasyState

This repository contains the documentation for the Unity Asset **Easy State**.

> **⚠️ Important Notice:**  
> Easy State has been deprecated in favor of Unity's official Behavior Graph package. Unity's Behavior Graph now provides native support for complex state and behavior management, making it a suitable replacement for Easy State. You can learn more about Unity's Behavior Graph [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.behavior@1.0/manual/behavior-graph.html).

### Legacy Package Availability

To support developers who have existing projects built with Easy State, I’ve added the original Unity package file to this repository. You can download it directly if you need to continue using Easy State in your project. However, please note that this asset is no longer actively maintained or supported.

### Overview of Easy State

Easy State was designed to help developers incorporate complex logic into their games with organization and efficiency. It combined elements of state machines, behavior trees, and utility nodes into a single, user-friendly framework. This tool prioritized lean, manageable code and empowered developers to focus on mission-critical functionality while managing repetitive elements.
